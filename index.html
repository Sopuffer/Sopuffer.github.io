                        My name is Sophie, and I am an aspiring, educated game designer and programmer.
                        I decided to become a game designer because I think games are an amazing medium
                        to tell stories. I also wanted to become a programmer because I wanted to have
                        the knowledge to build a game on my own.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Lead">
                        I have studied at Uppsala University in Visby and their Bachelor's of Arts program <i>
                            Game Design and
                            Programming
                        </i>. I'm also currently attending Forsbergs Yrkesh√∂gskola in Stockholm and
                        their <i>Game Programming</i> course. Throughout my education, I have developed games in
                        C++, C#, and through the Unity and Unreal 5 game engines.
                        With my education almost completed, I am currently looking for an opportunity
                        to enter the game industry. I am certain that I could assist you with my knowledge,
                        skills, and ambitious personality. I am also a people person, and higly enjoy working
                        in teams.

                    <p class="Lead">
                        <i>Eco-System</i> is a point-and-click game I created with my friends for the Game Jam Game Jobs Live. The game is a simulation of taking
                        care of a forest, starting with one plant. Depending on how well you treat the plants, the happier they are and the more seeds are produced. Every life
                        counts in the game, and every plant contributes, either by creating seeds, adding clouds to the world, or becoming soil.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Lead">
                        I developed the Day Manager, the plants and the animals. I made sure the plants grew and that their state of happiness is dependent on the amount of water they have.
                        I also developed the animals to spawn when there is enough of their favorite plants. For the Day Manager, I programmed the temperature of
                        the day, which depending on the heat takes away more amount of water from the plants.

                    <p class="Lead">
                        <i>Lantern</i> is my passion project that I am currently working on. The game is developed in Unreal5, and the
                        programming is 80 % developed in C++, and 20% Unreal Blueprint. The level is a tutorial level, and the goal of the player
                        is to capture the flame, and use it to light lanterns in the room. However, as soon as the player captures the flame, a
                        demon will awaken and take the player back to the starting point.
                    </p>
                    <p class="Lead">
                        As of now, the only way to defeat the demon is to light the lantern in the room. This will be updated in the
                        future. Also, UI needs to be added. Those are the upcoming goals of the game.

                        <i>Cred</i> is a mobile platform game developed in Unity. The game is about living in Stockholm and preparing
                        for the outside life by dressing up different characters with clothing and accessories. The clothings have different
                        amount of style points, which will affect the rewards at the end of each mission. Clothing can also be combined, upcycled,
                        to create a new article of clothing, and if the player has two articles of the same clothing, one of those can be donated,
                        which will update the other and give it more style points.
                    </p>

                        I got to work on the upcycling and donation of the clothes. I also worked on dressing up the client and the UX

                        <i>Neon Knights</i> is a computer game developed in Unity. It features an alien traveling through different levels to defeat
                        the enemies that have taken over their home. The player can use both a long-reached and a short-reached weapon, magic staff
                        or sword, which they can use for attacks. Once all the enemies have been defeated, they can move to the next level. Once a
                        level is completed, the player returns to the main HUB where then can enter different paths that have been opened for them
                        after completing their mission.

                        <i>Sticky Business</i> is a computer game developed in Unity. The player is a bear who harvest and sells honey.
                        It is an incremental game, similar to <i>Cookie Clicker</i>, where the player clicks on the Honey Hive house to collect honey,
                        the honey can be traded for money, and with that money, the player can by bee-keepers and honey-salesman, both of which helps
                        produce honey and money faster.
